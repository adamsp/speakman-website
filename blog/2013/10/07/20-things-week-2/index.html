	<div class="entry-content"><p>Week 2 has not gone so well. I&#8217;ve managed to produce what I wanted (a MultiColumnListView control for Android), but I encountered more problems than I expected. Really, I should&#8217;ve expected that. It&#8217;s software development we&#8217;re talking about here, after all.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>I&#8217;ve been busy in the evenings this week (The Auckland .NET user group, and <a href="http://codemania.co.nz/">Codemania</a>, totally writing off two evenings, for a start), and had a couple of bad days at work - which doesn&#8217;t inspire one to write much code in the evenings. To go with my busy week, <a href="http://www.dia.govt.nz/Daylight-Saving">Daylight Saving</a> started last Sunday night, which meant I was more tired than usual all the time as well. Oh, and the NHL season started too - there went another few hours (and go the Canucks!).</p>

<p>With all of that going on, I didn&#8217;t really get a whole lot done. I had a semi-working solution last week (didn&#8217;t have scroll clamping working, or view caching, or assorted other things), but I wasn&#8217;t really happy with it. I spent some time looking at the <code>ListView</code> source code, and realised that at some 3700 lines long (as at API level 18), I&#8217;d be better of reusing as much of that as possible.</p>

<p>So I tried &#8216;wrapping&#8217; 1..N list views instead, with the idea being that for all incoming method calls I&#8217;d pass the request to either the correct view, or all views, depending on the request. Turns out there are a lot of public methods that need redirecting - I soon gave up on that. I was pretty disinterested in writing code at the time, so it&#8217;s possible that this approach still has potential. Howeverâ€¦</p>

<p>My &#8216;final&#8217; solution is similar to what I had at the end of last week (and indeed, similar to the one I wrote at the beginning of the year). It&#8217;s significantly more efficient than my original attempt (I understand how to use <code>onMeasure</code> and <code>onLayout</code> a lot better now), but it can definitely still be better. I need to handle saving instance state, scroll &#8216;fling&#8217;, and certain touch events, as well as generally cleaning up the code, as it&#8217;s pretty poor in a few places. On the plus side, it doesn&#8217;t over scroll past 0 or past the end, the number of columns can be supplied as an attribute in XML, and views are removed &amp; cached for re-use (like an adapter view should do).</p>

<p>I tried to get it ready to put on Github tonight, but I couldn&#8217;t get Android Studio to do what I wanted - I tried importing the module to test in another project, but it wouldn&#8217;t work (I was getting &#8220;internal IDE errors&#8221;). Also, the custom attributes aren&#8217;t working, so I&#8217;ve decided to hold off on uploading this for now. If I can get it to a stage I&#8217;m happy with this week, I&#8217;ll put it up - I&#8217;d like to start on something else this week, though, so I&#8217;m not sure if that&#8217;ll happen.</p>

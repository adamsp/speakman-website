	<h2 class="title">20 Things in 20 Weeks</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I&#8217;ve been realising more and more how much time I spend doing things that aren&#8217;t productive. Watching TV, playing video games, etc. While some down time is important, I&#8217;ve got all these ideas rattling around my head that I&#8217;d love to work on, but I keep putting off until some ever-distant &#8216;later&#8217;. So I&#8217;ve decided that for the next few months I&#8217;d like to be (more) productive, and I&#8217;m setting myself a challenge. I plan on implementing <strong>20 Things in 20 Weeks</strong>. Some of these ideas are tiny apps, or blog posts, or scripts, and will only take a few hours to complete. Others are rather large and may take a few weeks of solid work.</p>

<!-- more -->


<p>There are a few reasons behind doing this. I&#8217;d like to actually have something to show for my downtime - I&#8217;ve had a bunch of these ideas for a long time now and have never gotten around to doing them. I want to keep learning - and the best way to learn is to write code and make mistakes. My software design skills (and UI design, for that matter) are somewhat lacking - the more mistakes I make, the more things I know not to do in the future. And I simply want to challenge myself.</p>

<p>I intend to complete all of this around my other obligations - working full time, obviously, and spending time with my partner, friends and family - so it may be a bit of a stretch, but I&#8217;m curious to see what I can achieve if I put my mind to it. At the very least, I&#8217;ll have <em>something</em> to show for my time at the end of it.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve written a few loose &#8216;rules&#8217; around what a Thing is, whether it counts towards the 20, how to keep track of myself, etc:</p>

<ul>
<li>A Thing is an idea for an app, a control, a library, <em>something</em> that is interesting, useful, helpful or simply helps me learn something new.</li>
<li>A Thing doesn&#8217;t have to be unique (for example a Stopwatch app is not unique in the slightest) but I have to learn, use or produce something new each time.</li>
<li>I might get part way through and decide something is &#8220;too much&#8221; to get done in the time frame, or I might simply not want to do it anymore - I can swap that idea out for something else, or ditch it completely.</li>
<li>If I can extract something out of any partially completed work into a useful control or a library for something then that counts as a Thing.</li>
<li>There is no rule that I must only work on one Thing at a time, or on the Things in any specific order.</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t have to produce a Thing every week, or only produce one Thing in any given week.</li>
<li>Things produced in earlier weeks can be used to help build things in later weeks.</li>
<li>I must detail at the end of each week what I have done - this should be in the form of a blog post, where I can go into detail, or just provide an overview, depending on how interesting the Thing(s) was/were.</li>
<li>If I make a Thing worthy of its own blog post, I should write a post for that as well as the weekly one. The blog post about the Thing is considered part of that Thing.</li>
<li>Some of the Things listed below <strong>are</strong> blog posts - this is OK. The &#8216;post about a Thing&#8217; described in the prior point is a retrospective post, rather than a pro-active post whose intent is to be a Thing.</li>
</ul>


<p>I&#8217;ve written up a quick list of ideas of Things I can do over this time. This list will change - I will update it as I go with links to posts, links to finished products, strike-throughs as I drop things and additions as I think of new Things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Common Android libraries base/sample project that people can copy (including ActionBarSherlock, HoloEverywhere, Guava, etc), with examples, plus rename script (for renaming all the namespaces and the app name etc) - potentially implemented as an Android Studio template?…</p></li>
<li><p>Stopwatch app with Start/Stop timer and Countdown functionality</p></li>
<li><p>Road Rules Comparison website/app for saying &#8220;I&#8217;m from New Zealand, what are the road rules in Canada that are different?&#8221; and displaying differences</p></li>
<li><p>Diary app/website, completely private, for recording what you did that day, including the ability to check in places (privately), what you learned, add pictures, etc, and a &#8220;What happened to me on this day last year/last month/last week&#8221; function</p></li>
<li><p>Text based Twitter client (Yatta - Yet another text-based Twitter app) designed specifically for not consuming much data - no pictures, manual refresh only, no link auto-expansion (Twitter might do this for you?…) etc</p></li>
<li><p>A Pinterest-style Android list view, implemented properly so you just attach a ListAdapter and you&#8217;re away (Attempted - <a href="../../../10/07/20-things-week-2/">Blog</a> - Etsy have <a href="https://github.com/etsy/AndroidStaggeredGrid">built a <em>far</em> superior one</a> though, so I doubt I&#8217;ll ever touch this again)</p></li>
<li><p>LeapMotion Windows controller to maximise/minimise/move windows left/right</p></li>
<li><p>Add a widget to Whats Shaking, NZ? (<a href="../../../../2014/01/01/20-things-weeks-13-and-14/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/wsnz-android/commit/813d1ec9a60c01277dad256877aacfe5b4e3178a">Github</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Sudoku solver (in Python?) (<a href="http://speakman.dev/blog/2014/01/20/20-things-week-17/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/sudoku-solver">Github</a>, and even a <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/sudoku-solver-gae">Google App Engine implementation</a>!)</p></li>
<li><p>Currency formatter class/tests/examples/blog posts (<a href="../../../10/21/android-currency-localisation-hell/">Blog post</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/CurrencyFormattingDemo">Github</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>App that shows current/max/min speed - should be ideal for using RxJava for streaming location data?</p></li>
<li><p>&#8216;Cartoonify&#8217; app that takes a photo + converts it to a cartoon</p></li>
<li><p>What&#8217;s Shaking, NZ? for iOS (partly written already)</p></li>
<li><p>Figure out how to fix the Twitter plugin on the side of this website. (&#8216;Fixed&#8217; it by <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/speakman-website/commit/7b87a9597e0505c668bd65a4114b3009452fc2d9">deleting it</a> - updated the theme at the same time, woo!)</p></li>
<li><p>CV/Resume app, with my work history, links to profiles, Twitter stream, G+ stream, etc</p></li>
<li><p>Basic RSS reader, maybe?…</p></li>
<li><p>Basic flash cards app - math, chemistry, physics, etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Social running app, like geocaching you&#8217;ve gotta find specific locations and check-in there for points, get more points the more people check in to your submitted favourite running spots</p></li>
<li><p>Time localisation differences for Samsung (and other?…) devices examples + blog post</p></li>
<li><p><del>Wedding website for my friends Michael and Rebecca</del> (Oops, they got married!)</p></li>
<li><p>Create a ‘global’ version of WSNZ + use Gson instead of manual parsing (Started - <a href="../../../../2014/01/01/20-things-weeks-13-and-14/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/WhatsShaking">Github</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>Open source Android app licenses page example - Settings app page comes from a file and that file is created during build - what about one-person apps where your build process is File -> Export? (<a href="../../24/android-open-source-licenses-page/">Blog post</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/AndroidLicensesPage">Github</a>)</p></li>
<li><p>A social network specifically for sharing cat pictures, because cats are awesome.</p></li>
<li><p>A class for parsing WCF formatted DateTime objects in Java (<a href="../../../10/14/20-things-week-3/">Blog</a>, <a href="https://gist.github.com/adamsp/6914482">Gist</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Twitter-feed Android Daydream, “Dream In Tweets” (<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=nz.net.speakman.android.dreamintweets">Play Store</a>, <a href="../../../10/28/20-things-week-5/">launch blog entry</a>, <a href="../../../12/02/20-things-week-10/">chasing down KitKat bugs blog entry</a>, and <a href="../../../12/09/20-things-week-11/">still chasing down KitKat bugs blog entry</a>, <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/DreamInTweets">Github</a>)</p></li>

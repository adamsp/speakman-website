	<h2 class="title">Reflections on finishing an Android app</h2>
	<div class="entry-content"><p>A few days ago I finally finished the application I&#8217;ve been working on in my spare moments over the last month or two. It&#8217;s called <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/wookmark">Wookmark Viewer</a> and it&#8217;s a simple little app that lets you browse the latest images saved on <a href="http://www.wookmark.com">Wookmark.com</a> (Wookmark is an &#8216;image bookmarking&#8217; site, so there&#8217;s all sorts of images from all over the web that get saved there). This was an interesting project for me, as I got to use a few different open source libraries (including one I ended up almost totally rewriting), switched IDE from Eclipse to IntelliJ, and had to figure out some new Android features I hadn&#8217;t used before.</p>

<p>This post-mortem picks apart what I enjoyed building, what caused me troubles, and what needs changing - the app is far from perfect.</p>

<!-- more -->


<h3>User Experience</h3>

<p>The app should be fairly easy to pick up and use for anyone who&#8217;s used an app with a sliding menu before. These include Facebook, NHL Game Center, YouTube and Falcon Pro, among others - so the sliding menu system is not an uncommon one. While I&#8217;ve tried to keep the user experience consistent, the final result is actually (in my opinion) quite bad, and completely inconsistent.</p>

<p>Swipe open the side-menu, and choose &#8216;New&#8217; (assuming you&#8217;re currently looking at &#8216;Popular&#8217; images). Now, press the Back button on the device - and exit the app. The idea of swapping the fragments in/out via the menu, instead of navigating to a new page, may be lost on the user. Certainly I&#8217;ve exited the app by accident a few times when I just wanted to go to the previous page.</p>

<p>However, even this poor behaviour isn&#8217;t consistent. If you go to the &#8216;Color Search&#8217; page and search of a colour, you can hit the Back button and return to the search page from the results. I consider this to be good behaviour on its own, but it&#8217;s still very confusing since it&#8217;s so different to every other page.</p>

<p>Finally, the &#8216;Settings&#8217; page is different again. Clicking on Settings brings forward an entirely new activity - with no access to the sliding menu, no branding (on 2.2/2.3), and no subheadings on the settings. On newer versions of Android you&#8217;re provided with a <code>PreferenceFragment</code> which you can use like a regular <code>PreferenceActivity</code>, but as a fragment. Unfortunately this has not been implemented in the support library, and I couldn&#8217;t find a quick/easy way of doing it, so (since I was keen to just get the damn thing finished) I went the easy way of just using a <code>PreferenceActivity</code> - resulting in this inconsistent behaviour.</p>

<h3>Open source libraries</h3>

<p>Wookmark Viewer utilises a total of 5 open source libraries: <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/SlidingMenu">SlidingMenu</a> for the menu system; <a href="https://github.com/JakeWharton/ActionBarSherlock">ActionBarSherlock</a> for the action bar view styling; <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/LazyList">LazyList</a> to lazy-load the images automatically in the background, off the UI thread; <a href="https://github.com/attenzione/android-ColorPickerPreference">ColorPickerPreference</a> for the colour picker; and finally <a href="https://github.com/adamsp/AntipodalWall">AntipodalWall</a> for the Pinterest-style view - more on this below.</p>

<p>Sliding Menu and ActionBar Sherlock worked well together - all I had to do was fork Sliding Menu and let the classes extend <code>SherlockFragment</code> and <code>SherlockActivity</code> instead. Easy. Open source is good for this - I was able to modify the code as necessary, on top of being able to step through the code when I wanted to know what was going on behind the scenes.</p>

<p>I made some modifications to the LazyList library as well. Originally it scaled all images it loaded; scaling is now optional for each image loaded, with the ability to set the scale factor when the <code>ImageLoader</code> class is instantiated. I also added the ability to supply a listener when you call <code>DisplayImage</code>, so that when the image is finished loading the calling class can update the UI - for example by removing a progress bar. I need to provide overloads for the <code>DisplayImage</code> method so that existing code can continue to use the class exactly as before, and then I&#8217;ll send a pull request back to the original author.</p>

<p>I chose the &#8216;AntipodalWall&#8217; library as my base Pinterest-style view to work with as it allowed a varying number of columns, worked on Android 2.2 and up, and was easy to set up - none of the other options met all those criteria. Unfortunately, the app quickly ran out of memory - there was no view recycling. This is fine for a static, finite number of resources, but the nature of the app means that there are an infinite number of images to load. I spent some time working on rewriting this to implement view recycling - it&#8217;s now an <code>AdapterView</code>, recycling views as they scroll off screen and supplying them back to the <code>getView</code> method of the <code>Adapter</code>. In addition I&#8217;ve overridden the <code>onSaveInstanceState</code> and <code>onRestoreInstanceState</code> methods so the scroll position and visible views are kept when the device is rotated or the app is paused.</p>

<p>There are a few problems with my implementation of this, however. It could be simplified a little, as I&#8217;m not sure my class and variable names will make too much sense to others, though I did work on refactoring that a little recently. It doesn&#8217;t handle views resizing (for example if content like an image loads in the background and a view needs resizing) - in fact, it requires views to come pre-measured from the <code>Adapter</code> and then scales them to fit, which only really works for my use case of knowing the size beforehand, and probably doesn&#8217;t work for views that contain more than just a single image. And it doesn&#8217;t behave as expected with respect to some methods; the <code>setNumberOfColumns</code> methods for example cannot be called at any time, it has to be called <em>before</em> you call <code>setAdapter</code>, which has the potential for confusion.</p>

<p>Once I&#8217;ve fixed these issues, I&#8217;m a little confused as to what I should be doing about sending a pull request or not. A diff between the original and my code reveals that while a lot of the original code remains, the file is mostly new content. Certainly, anyone who was using the old library would not be able to use my version without a significant refactor - they&#8217;d have to implement <code>Adapter</code>, for a start. So I don&#8217;t know if I should leave my fork as it is - a fork - or send a pull request, or create a new repository with a new name as a new project altogether. When I&#8217;m happy with it, I&#8217;ll probably send an email to the creator of the original project and get his opinion; I&#8217;m more than happy to send the PR if he wants it!</p>

<h3>What&#8217;s the point?</h3>

<p>Well, for an actual use-case for the app, as the API stands right now there isn&#8217;t much of one, really. The mobile site works well, looks a lot better, and offers much greater functionality. But it does have some limitations - it only offers a single-column view for images, for example.</p>

<p>Mostly, writing this app was simply good experience. I got some experience with some new libraries, and a new API - which is great, as reading other peoples code is an excellent way to grow as a developer. I learned a lot about the Android application life cycle (which I&#8217;d effectively managed to ignore with my other Android app), and figured out how to recycle views efficiently.</p>

<h3>Why isn&#8217;t it on the Play Store?</h3>

<p>Currently, there&#8217;s no way to filter adult/NSFW content. While these are tagged on the website, that information is unfortunately not available in the data returned from the API. I&#8217;ve been in contact with the creator of the Wookmark website recently, and asked if it&#8217;s possible to add this information - if so, I can filter all NSFW content, and obey the &#8216;No nudity&#8217; rule of the Play Store <a href="https://play.google.com/about/developer-content-policy.html">developer content policy</a>.</p>

<p>Until then, if you want to load the app onto your device manually, you can either build it from source or I can send you an APK file - just send me a message on <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsnz">Twitter</a>.</p>

<h3>Other thoughts</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, Color Search doesn&#8217;t work that well. Indexing images by colour is, I understand, fairly difficult. It works for values such as 0xFF0000 (red), or 0x000000 (black) - but not for 0xFA0000 (slightly less saturated red). A little experimentation shows the search works for colour values 0xXXYYZZ - that is, where the R/G/B values are chosen from the set of numbers 00, 11, 22, …, DD, EE, FF, rather than the full range 00-FF. I can probably hack this fairly easily to find a &#8220;closest&#8221; colour to the one that comes out of the colour picker - this is a better solution than the current case of not finding any results at all, in most cases.</p>

<p>Partway through development of this app I switched from Eclipse to IntelliJ - I wish I&#8217;d done it sooner. IntelliJ worked immediately with my already installed Android SDK, and after figuring out a few nuances I&#8217;ve found it to be a significantly easier IDE to use, and much more stable. One problem I&#8217;ve recently noticed though is that Eclipse used tab indentation, and IntelliJ uses 4 spaces, so my indentation on any class I&#8217;ve edited in IntelliJ is now a mixture of both. Oops.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all the thoughts I have for now. It&#8217;s unfortunate I can&#8217;t keep this app up on the Play Store, as I did spend some time on it, but that&#8217;s the way of things, I guess. If I can get a little extra info out of the API then it&#8217;ll only take a few minutes to update and publish. In the meantime, I&#8217;ve sure learned a lot!</p>

I'm originally from New Zealand, but have been living in Canada since 2014. I was the Engineering Lead at [Bridgit](http://gobridgit.com) where I managed a team of talented devs building a product for a diverse and often atypical user-base. I've been a senior Android developer at [Kik](https://www.kik.com/), improving legacy code and building features for millions of users in a large multi-national team.

Currently I live Vancouver where I work on the Android app for [Slack](https://slackhq.com).

You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamsnz), or email me at adam@(thisdomain).

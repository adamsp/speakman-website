I write code; some of it bad, some of it good. I'm working hard to write less of the bad.

This site will cover my adventures as I dabble in all sorts of different technologies.

I'm currently living in Auckland, New Zealand, and am looking for a development job - I've been on holiday since the end of November 2012 and am looking to get back into work. If you're interested in hiring me (or in an interview, at least), you can tweet me [@adamsnz](https://twitter.com/adamsnz), <a href="mailto:adam@speakman.net.nz?Subject=Employment%20opportunity">email me</a>, or even contact me on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=137085845) if that's your thing. Ideally I'd like to work with something that utilises my Math background, before I forget it all - however I'm interested in hearing what's available in all different areas.

I graduated from the University of Auckland in June 2011, majoring in Computer Science with a heavy Math influence in my selected papers. My experience includes 18 months work at a company here in Auckland called [Pingar](http://pingar.com) where we developed a Natural Language Processing API for extracting useful information from unstructured text. My experience there included (but was not limited to) technologies such as C# (.NET 3.5/4), Java, Mercurial (Hg) source control, Amazon EMR/EC2/S3, NLP libraries such as Mallet.

Some of the tasks I completed while at Pingar:

* Redesign and rearchitecture of the core API product, consolidating multiple endpoints into one, removing code duplication and enabling easy addition of new languages
* Conversion from an old ASMX style API to one running on WCF, supporting both SOAP and RESTful interfaces
* Building an internal API testing & example usage application in WPF
* Establishing & documenting a process for processing raw XML data dumps on Amazon Elastic MapReduce clusters to generate the required data files for the Pingar API
* Maintaining and updating code documentation (using Sandcastle to auto generate docs from code) and user SDKs for both Java and C#
* Worked with the research team in creating a taxonomy generation tool in Java, using Solr document store and Sesame triple store, along with assorted external APIs
* Interacting with customers, including working through a proof-of-concept for [large scale processing on an Amazon EC2 cluster](http://www.pingar.com/processing-100-gb-of-data-using-pingar-api-on-amazon/) and posting [release notes](http://www.pingar.com/new-features-in-pingar-api-3-1/).
* Suggesting & implementing a multi-threaded processing solution which resulted in a 50% speed increase in certain API features
* Maintaining some large regular expressions for extracting common pattern based information such as phone numbers

In my spare time, I like to play with mobile development. [What's Shaking, NZ?](http://www.whatsshaking.co.nz) is an earthquake monitoring & notification app available on Android, Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8 - and I plan on releasing an iOS version sometime soon too. I'm currently working on an Android app to browse images available on [Wookmark](http://www.wookmark.com), an image bookmarking site. My code is all available on [Github](https://github.com/adamsp) - I'm slowly learning how to bend Git to my will.

So, if you like what you see, <a href="mailto:adam@speakman.net.nz?Subject=Employment%20opportunity">hire me</a>. I won't disappoint!

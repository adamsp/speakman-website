I'm originally from New Zealand, but have been living and working in Waterloo, Ontario for the last two years. Most recently, I was the Engineering Lead at [Bridgit](http://gobridgit.com) where I managed a team of talented devs building a product for a diverse and often atypical user-base.

My passions lie in mobile development; I've been working on Android for four years and iOS for nearly two. If you're interested in hiring me, get in touch - I'm currently looking for new opportunities in the mobile space where I get to work with a diverse team and contribute to open-source. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamsnz), or email me at adam@(thisdomain).

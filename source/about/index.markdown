I'm originally from New Zealand, but recently moved to Waterloo, Ontario. I'm the Engineering Lead at [Bridgit](http://gobridgit.com) where I manage a team of talented devs building a product for a diverse and often atypical user-base. It's challenging and rewarding work - if you're interested in joining us, check out our [careers page](http://gobridgit.com/company/#careers) for openings.

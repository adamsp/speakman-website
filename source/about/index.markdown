I'm a software developer living in Auckland, New Zealand. I'm currently with [Vista](http://www.vista.co.nz) developing desktop and mobile applications for cinemas around the world. The main product I work on is our Android app, used for purchasing tickets at cinemas around the world.

Apart from Android, I also have experience (both through Vista and through my work with [Pingar](http://pingar.com)) in iOS development, WCF services, text analytics and Hadoop on Amazon Elastic MapReduce, among other things.

My partner and I are planning a move to Toronto in early 2014. If youâ€™re looking for an Android developer in Toronto, please [get in touch](mailto:adam@speakman.net.nz) for more information, or you can find me on the social media linked above.

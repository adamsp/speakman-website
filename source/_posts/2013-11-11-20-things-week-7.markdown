Not much in the way of code this week; work’s been a bit hectic, and I had a wedding to attend on Saturday. I did write a post on [avoiding an OutOfMemoryError on older Android devices when displaying large bitmaps](/blog/2013/11/10/handling-outofmemoryerror-with-large-bitmaps-on-older-android-devices/). 

Speaking of that wedding, it was the one I was going to make a website for - guess that won’t be happening, then... oops.

Actually managed to get some code written this week, though it's still pretty rough - I've got a basic widget working for What's Shaking, NZ? for Android. Exciting stuff; that'll be polished up and good to go next week. It was actually really easy to do, as I can update it directly from my existing background service (which polls the NZ Geonet API).

Also wrote a [blog post on a common Java encoding issue](/blog/2013/12/17/broken-jsonobject-creation-from-a-utf-8-input-string) - basically, when you've got a UTF-8 file with a Byte Order Mark at the start, things that parse that can freak out if they're not expecting it. Easiest way to avoid it is to get rid of the BOM altogether.

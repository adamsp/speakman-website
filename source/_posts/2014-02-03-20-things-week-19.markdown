Broke my Github streak this week, at 31 days - in fact, I didn't get any programming done this week. My partner and I left Auckland on Wednesday afternoon and didn't arrive home until late Sunday evening. We travelled around the Coromandel peninsula and spent time climbing mountains, visiting beaches, doing touristy things - and we got engaged! I'd say that that's a pretty good excuse for missing a week.
